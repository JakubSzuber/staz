# Description generator for clothes from fashion4you.com.pl

This is a project made during the internship. Repository functionality:<br>
The user from the Django interface enters the SKU number, then the tags and photos of the product are displayed and inserted into the form, then the user has to download displayed images and upload them after which the user is allowed to generate a description by pressing a button that sends a query to the FastAPI container along with tags from the form and a photo in bit form. The FastAPI container then generates additional tags based on the provided photo using the AWS Recognition API, and then using the generated tags together with the provided tags, the final description is generated by the appropriate query to the OpenAI API and then the final description is returned to the Django interface. Furthermore, the cloth is saved as a record in a PostgreSQL database.

- API_KEY_1, API_KEY_2, API_KEY_3 (API keys that can be used outside to communicate to FastAPI container)

**/staz/my_tennis_club/members:**
- FASTAPI_KEY (of the FastAPI's keys like e.g. value of API_KEY_1)

**/staz/my_tennis_club/my_tennis_club**

## Commands to execute compose:
- `cd staz/my_tennis_club`
- `docker compose --env-file ../api_container/.env up -d --build`
